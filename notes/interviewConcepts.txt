What is Big O notation, and why is it useful?
	Big O is an efficiency measurement for programs. It's useful because it provides a relative scale of 'time' that a program will take.
	O(N) for example depends on a set number (e.g. looping through an array), where O(log(N)) is more efficient because it is less than N (e.g. binary search)

What is the DOM?
	Document Object Model: an object oriented representation of HTML that the browser creates.
	Javascript uses the DOM to change HTML elements, CSS styling, react to clicks/input, create events

What is the event loop?
	The event loop is the organization of how/when javascript calls various functions. It calls queued events from the event queue once the call stack is clear.

What is a closure?

How does prototypal inheritance work, and how is it different from classical inheritance? (this is not a useful question IMO, but a lot of people like to ask it)
How does this work?

What is event bubbling and how does it work? (this is also a bad question IMO, but a lot of people like to ask it too)

Describe a few ways to communicate between a server and a client. Describe how a few network protocols work at a high level (IP, TCP, HTTP/S/2, UDP, RTC, DNS, etc.)

What is REST, and why do people use it?

My website is slow. Walk me through diagnosing and fixing it. What are some performance optimizations people use, and when should they be used?

What frameworks have you used? What are the pros and cons of each? Why do people use frameworks? What kinds of problems do frameworks solve?
